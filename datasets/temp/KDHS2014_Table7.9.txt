1 Includes female condom, LAM, withdrawal, other modern and other traditional methods
2 Includes infrequent sex/husband away, difficult to get pregnant/menopausal, and marital dissolution/separation

5 The episodes of use included in this column are a subset of the discontinued episodes included in the discontinuation rate. A woman is considered to have switched to another method if she used a different method in the month following discontinuation or if she gave “wanted a more effective method” as the reason for discontinuation and started another method within two months of discontinuation.
6 Number of episodes of use includes both episodes of use that were discontinued during the period of observation and episodes of use that were not discontinued during the period of observation
