1 DPT-HepB-Hib is also called pentavalent.
2 Polio 0 is the polio vaccination given at birth. The data on polio vaccination were adjusted for a likely misinterpretation of polio 0 and polio 1; for children whose mothers reported that they received three doses of DPT-HepB-Hib and polio 0, polio 1, and polio 2, it was assumed that polio 0 was in fact polio 1, polio 1 was polio 2 and polio 2 was polio 3.
3 BCG, measles, and three doses each of DPT-HepB-Hib and polio vaccine (excluding polio vaccine given at birth)
4 BCG, measles, and three doses each of DPT-HepB-Hib, polio (excluding polio vaccine given at birth), and pneumococcal vaccine
